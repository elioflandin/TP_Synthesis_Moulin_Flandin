**Synthesis Lab**
***enseash - ENSEA in the Shell***

*Description*
This project is part of the synthesis practical lab at ENSEA, designed to create a micro shell named enseash. The shell provides basic command execution functionalities, displays exit codes, and measures execution times of launched programs.
The implementation follows good programming practices, including clear function separation, meaningful variable names, and proper use of system calls.

*Objectives*
The main objectives of this project were:
Implement a micro shell with a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).
Execute commands and return a prompt for further input.
Display the exit code or signal of the previous command.
Measure and display execution times using clock_gettime.
Support command arguments.
Handle redirection for stdin and stdout.
Exit the shell gracefully with "exit" or <Ctrl>+D.
